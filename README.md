üéì Dual-degree candidate (MBA & MS in MIS) at Iowa State University with over 4 years of experience driving data-informed strategies across analytics, business operations, and marketing. My passion lies at the intersection of data science, product strategy, and business impact, where I turn raw data into actionable insights and meaningful outcomes.

üìä At Accenture, I gained hands-on experience in business operations and data analysis, sharpening my skills in stakeholder communication, dashboarding, and cross-functional collaboration. In my recent role as a Data Science for Public Good fellow, I led a team of undergraduates to tackle real-world community issues using tools like Python, Tableau, and GitHub.

üß† I thrive in fast-paced environments where I can lead initiatives, mentor teams, and dive deep into data storytelling. Whether it's managing projects, guiding policy initiatives as a student senate leader, or leading wellness classes as a certified yoga instructor, I bring empathy, structure, and strategy to everything I do.

üîç I‚Äôm actively exploring full-time opportunities in Data Science | Product Management | Business Analytics‚Äîroles where I can blend my technical capabilities with my leadership mindset.

Let‚Äôs connect if you‚Äôre passionate about data-driven innovation, inclusive leadership, or just love a good dashboard!

> Feel free to connect and future collaborations ‚è¨
